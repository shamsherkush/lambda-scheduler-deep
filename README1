# **EC2 Scheduler**
## Save money by scheduling your ec2 instances

ec2-scheduler is a service powered by AWS Lambda. Setup up a tag `AutoStartSchedule` and `AutoStopSchedule` with cron values. This gives a flexibility for configuring start and stop times for EC2 Instances as per need.

The lambda runs every 30 mins and validate every instance tag values with specified time zone datetime. 
 
This lambda has optional POST api support to start/stop individual instance or group of instances.

## Configure EC2 Instances

Instances to be scheduled must have a `AutoStartSchedule`, `AutoStopSchedule` and `ScheduledShutdown` tags
 ```
 Tag:                  Value:
 	
 AutoStartSchedule     0 9 * * *             
 AutoStopSchedule      0 21 * * *
 ScheduledShutdown     true
 Domain                MUMBAI
 ```
 
 1. **AutoStartSchedule :** 
    The particular instance will start based on this cron value.
 2. **AutoStopSchedule :** 
    The particular instance will stop based on this cron value.
 3. **ScheduledShutdown :** 
    The particular instance needs to be part of the scheduler is decided based on the value true/false.
 4. **Domain :** 
    This flag is used to group the instances and start or stop the group instances manually using api mentioned below.
   
 
 Incase, if needed to exclude particular ec2 instance to be excluded from scheduler, set `ScheduledShutdown` as `false`


    We are using serverless for lambda setup on AWS
    
    ```./1 <{stage} [{aws profile}]>``` stage can be dev or staging
    

## Start and Stop Instance

Once lambda is deployed, you will get the POST api endpoint.
